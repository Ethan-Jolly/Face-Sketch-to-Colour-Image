# Face-Sketch-to-Colour-Image

Training multiple different deep learning autoencoder models to take pencil sketches of faces, and turn them in to coloured images or take as input the coloured images and turn them in to sketch images. The different auto encoders which we test are standard deep auto-encoders (DAE), convolutional variational auto-encoders (ConvVAE) and convolutional auto-encoders (CAE).

## Examples of image data

## Example Results from the different models

Where the columns left to right are input images, goal output images, output from DAE, output from CAE and output from ConvVAE.
